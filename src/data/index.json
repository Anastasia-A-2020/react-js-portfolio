She immediately warned me that she had little experience but assured me she could do what I needed. I trusted her. As a result, instead of one project, we completed two. She was easy to work with, always available, took my design preferences into account, addressed my comments about the calculator's functionality, and frequently suggested her own ideas on how to improve things from a user's perspective. I am very satisfied with our collaboration. Thanks to her for the cooperation.",
